### All cryptography algorithms are implemented in Java (for education purposes)
These implementations are for learning purposes. The implementations may be less efficient than the Java standard library.

## Structure
All cryptography algorithms are implemented with a proper format [directory](STRUCTURE.java)

## Algorithms
See our [directory](DIRECTORY.md).
